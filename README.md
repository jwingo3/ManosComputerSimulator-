# ManosComputerSimulator-
final project for Computer architecture 

Manos’ Computer that is introduced in his book Computer System Architecture is a powerful learning tool for understanding how the basic design computers work. 
Though it is a theoretical computer that does not actually exist, it exemplifies some of the most important concepts that nearly all computers use. 
Learning how it works is essential for understanding the fundamentals of Computer Science. 
Because of this fact, a Java Application called Manos’ Computer Simulator (MCS) was made in order to facilitate learning the basic concept of the computer.

The paper in this repo shows the details on how the application was designed.
